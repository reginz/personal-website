        Hi, I’m Zeynep! I’m a <span className="font-medium ">UX Engineer</span> a background in Computer Science. My passion lies in creating accessible, user-centered technologies and crafting intuitive digital experiences.

        <br></br>        <br></br>
        I’ve had the pleasure of working on a variety of projects, from marketing websites to production level web applications used by thousands of users. And those experiences all showed me the importance of understanding your audience, UX and research.
        <br></br>        <br></br>

        My tech career began in 2020, during the pandemic, when I had the opportunity to dive deep into coding and start building websites. The upside of everything being online was the chance to collaborate with amazing people from around the world.
        <br></br>        <br></br>
        Currently I'm a UX Engineer specializing in designing AI-driven products. My skills include user research, feature design, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to bring all aspects of the designs to life.
        <br></br>        <br></br>

        Over the years, I’ve focused on creating AI-powered design experiences for small startups and B2B companies. My recent work includes SaaS platforms and AI-driven lawyer-centric features at Saga and Concide.
        <br></br>        <br></br>

        I’m currently leading the feature design and UI development of a small but highly productive team at Saga, and my deep understanding of AI technologies is allowing me to collaborate seamlessly with engineering teams and stakeholders.

        When I’m not coding or designing, you can find me going to reformer pilates, reading interesting articles, and traveling around the world, meeting with new interesting friends.
