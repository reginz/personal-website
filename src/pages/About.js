      <p>
        I’m Zeynep -currently studying Computer Engineering and looking for an
        intership. My interests lie in creating accessible and user-centered
        technologies. I also love crafting web apps, participating in fun
        projects, and playing piano once in a while. 
        
        <br></br><br></br>My tech career started
        rather early, when I started collage in 2020. Since we were all in
        lockdown, I had plenty of time to teach myself how to code and started
        building websites. One upside when we were in the pandemic was,
        everything was online so I had the change to work with amazing people
        all over the world.
        <br></br><br></br> I recently was working as a Frontend Engineer at
        Oslo Philantrophic Exchange, where I’ve had the change to learn how to
        integrate databases and APIs seamlessly. 
        
        <br></br><br></br>My first role and the role
        where I’ve learnt the most was Web Developer at Brieferr. Since it was a
        startup, I had the chance to wear many hats. I have conducted UX
        research and talked to users, and from that I’ve built a full-stack app
        using React and Node.js. 
        
        <br></br><br></br>When I’m not busy with my studies and work you
        can find me biking, reading intresting stuff and participating in coding
        projects. If you would like to get in touch, email me. Or reach out to
        me from my socials.
