# A Web Developer's Journey: From Coding to Crafting Experiences

Like many tales of discovery, my story doesn't start with a ground-breaking epiphany or a light-bulb moment. It begins in the comfort of the familiar, within the well-trodden paths of web and frontend development. As a web developer, I spent years building digital tools, each line of code a testament to the beauty of programming.

My first encounter with an unexplored dimension of web development surfaced as I delved deeper into it. While researching about user experience, I found myself drawn to the works of Jesse James Garrett. His perspective on UX/UI design was like discovering a new language—a language that wasn’t speaking with the programs, but speaking with the people using them.

Garrett's insights introduced me to the two intertwined aspects of user experience: **software** and **hypertext**. The software aspect deals with the functional layer of a website or application, emphasizing the tasks a user completes and the process behind them. In contrast, the hypertext aspect focuses on the informational layer, the information that the site offers and its significance to the user.

This two-pronged perspective changed my approach completely to web development. I realized that **building efficient code was just one side of the coin**. The other side lay in creating digital environments that not only perform tasks effectively but also provide valuable, easily-navigable information spaces for users.

The impact of Garrett's approach extended beyond the professional sphere—it was transformative on a personal level too. It fostered a deeper connection between me and the end-users, leading me to question: How can I create digital tools that resonate with the people using them?

As I delved further into UX design, my role began to evolve. I was no longer solely a developing, but rather a crafting experiences for users. I aimed to create not just functional digital tools, but intuitive ones that would resonate with the users.

Embracing this dual focus on functionality and user experience had a profound effect on my professional journey. It eventually led me to choose a path where I could directly apply these principles: *freelancing*. As a freelancer, each project presents a new opportunity to use my technical skills while crafting user experiences that are not just functional, but truly delightful.

In sharing my journey, I hope to inspire other developers to explore the transformative potential of UX/UI design. Developement is a field that extends beyond the boundary of coding.

Today, I continue to apply these insights on a freelance basis, creating enjoyable digital experiences with each project. Feel free to explore my work and [reach out on UpWork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01c171f587dbc329c6). Let's connect and create something amazing.
