# Everything I’ve learnt from decorating my tiny room

I have an extremely small bedroom it’s 2x3 meters (approx. 64^2 foot). And I’ve learnt a lot about interior design for small spaces while decorating and designing there. I am not an interior designer or someone with education about this topics. These are just my experiences and advices learnt along the way. 

### If you have columns dividing your small room and making it even smaller, try using them to create separate spaces in one room.
Columns can be really pain in the ass, especially if your space is already small. But I have found a way to use them to my favor. I use them to create separate living areas. In my bedroom, I decided to separate my working space and sleeping space. In my case I have located my desk facing to the wall and window side of the columns, this way I don’t get distracted or wanna go back to bed when I start working. 
Even if it is in the same space your brain doesn’t think of it that way anymore.

### Transform empty holes created by your columns as shelfs.
Since your space is really small, there is a big possibility that column to wall length will be shorter than the length of your bed; hence the empty useless holes. One practical way to use these holes is to transform them to shelfs or stands for your cup of water. You can basically get a cut-out wood and fix them to your wall. You got yourself a little, cute bed side book shelf or coffee or water stand.

### Use open dressers
If you need to put your wardrobe in the room, you might want to take a look at IKEA’s open dressers. This is great for small spaces because it creates the illusion of a big space, it gives a space for room to breathe. With closed wardrobes your room will look a lot smaller. 

### Small = Cozy
You can use the disadvantage of living in a small space to an advantage, by adding more coziness into it. There are many accessories and textures you can use to make an area more cozy: 

1. **Plants**; greens are always good and some plants coming from your ceiling will make your room look spacier. 
2. **Art**; the key to personalizing a room is art. You can get thrifted art or a one from your family or even you can make it yourself, but the key is it should make you feel at home. This will definitely give your space a personality.
3. **Plaid fabric**; If you are into Christmas/fireplace kinda cozy, you can always play around with textures and colors. The most iconic texture of that aesthetic is plaid.
4. **Poping colors**; However if you are more a minimalist, you can use an accent colors in some places to make your room cozier. The key is you should pick warm tones. Otherwise it will not create a cozy effect.
5. **Wood**; If you are not using a wood colored furniture, you can get a warm wood colored mirror or accessories.
